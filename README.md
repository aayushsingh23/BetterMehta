## Current Issues

- Stationery shops on campus offer printing services but become overcrowded during peak times, especially before classes.
- Only two computers are available to send documents to the printers, causing significant delays.
- The current process involves students emailing their documents to the vendor, who then downloads and prints themâ€”this is inefficient and time-consuming.

## Proposed Solution

### For Students (Website)

Develop a cross-platform website for students to upload their documents, accessible via both phones and laptops. The website will allow students to:

- Upload documents for printing.
- Pay for the print service online.
- Collect the printed document from the shop at their convenience by scanning their student ID card.

### For Vendors (Desktop Application)

- Develop a desktop application that connects all printers to a single computer.
- The application will call our API to fetch documents along with the information of the student.
- The document will be labeled for collection and then printed automatically on approval by the vendor.
